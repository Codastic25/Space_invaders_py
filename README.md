# Space_invaders_py
A space inavders game (not finish)

Using pygame to do this project, the graphic interface is not complete and there is only 1 wave of ennemis moving together.
Space for shoot and the arrows to move.
This code was a bit hard and I asked for some parts suggestions or corrections from ChatGPT
